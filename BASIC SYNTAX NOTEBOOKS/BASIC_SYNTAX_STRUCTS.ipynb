    "# STRUCTS (STRUCTURES)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Custom __value__ data type; lightweight version of classes, but doesn't require the creation of new instances to use them*\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLES:\n",
    "* Basic numeric types (`int`, `long`, `float`, etc.)\n",
    "* Basic game development geometry (x,y points, rectangle, color, etc.)\n",
    "* Game development objects (player, enemies, physics, etc.)\n",
    "* DateTime manipulation\n",
    "* Monetary/financial manipulation\n",
    "* IoT sensor data (temperatures, accelerator data, etc.)\n",
    "* Custom configuration settings in your app/game\n",
    "* Mock test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n",
    "* Structs are used/passed in by value rather than reference (unlike classes)\n",
    "* Structs are not allowed to inherit from classes nor other structs, only interfaces\n",
    "* Fields CANNOT have initializers, e.g.: `private string _color = \"Blue\";`\n",
    "* Structs CANNOT have a custom parameter-less constructor (__BEFORE C# 10__)\n",
    "* If a custom constructor is written, ALL parameters must be initialized in the constructor\n",
    "* Classes can reference itself or create same type instances within itself (since each instance is in a different place in memory)\n",
    "    * Structs cannot because it will create a never-ending recursive definition\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## GOOD PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS:\n",
    "* Use structs for small/simple data-centric types that provide little to no behavior\n",
    "    * Use classes for more involved/complex object types that focus on behavior\n",
    "* All of the possible values for an instantiated struct have the same hash code using the `GetHashCode()` method\n",
    "    * This increases the likelihood of causing hash collisions, making systems insecure\n",
    "        * Not a huge deal unless you decide to use structs for stuff that needs to be secure (e.g. passwords)\n",
    "        * In that case, you would need to implement a more complex hashing algorithm\n",
    "    * UNLESS you create custom `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` method implementations in the struct\n",
    "* In addition to the above method implementations, you might also need to implement operator methods for `==` and `!=`\n",
    "* It is NOT good practice to use referene types inside struct implementations; use only primitive types\n",
    "* It's good practice to use the `readonly` modifier for structs to make it immutable upon instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## MEMORY/PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:\n",
    "* Class instances are stored on the heap, whereas structs are *mostly* stored on the stack\n",
    "    * However in some cases, structs can also be stored on the heap as well (especially if they are contained/used inside of a class)\n",
    "* An array of instantiated structs are all stored in the same place/reference in heap memory\n",
    "* Classes relative to structs: each instantiated class object, even if they are contained inside an array, are still each located in different places in heap memory\n",
    "    * The array containing class instances will only contain pointer references to the different locations of each instance in heap memory\n",
    "* Structs cannot be `null`, they will automatically have a place allocated in memory for it regardless of whether it's being used or not\n",
    "    * Classes on the other hand can have a pointer reference to `null` until the instance is initalized and a reference is established using the `new` keyword\n",
    "* Can be efficient when it comes to performance, but only if the instantiated struct is under 16 bytes in size\n",
    "    * Since structs are passed in by value rather than reference, structs will need to be copied and will be performance-intensive if the struct is too big\n",
    "    * e.g GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) are expensive to use as a struct since they are exactly 16 bytes in size\n",
    "    * Therefore, it's best to stick to simple implementations when using structs"
